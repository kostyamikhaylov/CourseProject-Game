Description:

This program opens a window. The window allows you to click two points inside it and builds a rectangle (one point is upper-left corner and the other is bottom-right). If you don't like rectangle, just rebuild it in the same way. Press the RIGHT mouse button here.

Then, if you press the LEFT mouse button INSIDE the shape, the window will close. Otherway, no reaction on clicks is provided.

You also can type 'q' letter to close the window anytime.
