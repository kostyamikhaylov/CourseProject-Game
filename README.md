# CourseProject-Game
working out a game with graphics


Possible plot:

A number of dots (let them be enemies) crossing a 2-D field from one side to the opposite. Player is to build some kind of defense (let them be towers) to kill enemies before they manage to cross the field. The only resourse for building towers is obtained due to killing enemies. Classic

Realization:

I'm going to use SDL or, more likely, object-oriented SFML. Actually, I've never worked with graphics, so I need to learn some additional information about SDL and SFML to be sure one of them suffices to my expectations. No futher details for now.

//28.03
Progress:
1) passed Lunev
2) managed to install SFML

Current aims:
1) start working with SFML (by reading tutorials or wathcing introducing videos)


//04.04
Progress:
1) learned about windows, shapes and events
2) wrote first program (directory FirstProg)

Current aims:
1) learn about sprites and textures (it'll be also useful for TechnoTrack course)


//12.04
Progress
1) learned about sprites and textures
2) wrote second program (I'm to lazy to upload it for now)

Current aims:
1) learn how to make sprites automatically;
2) go on reading SFML tutorials


//05.05
Progress:
1) learned how to work with object's collisions
2) implemented smth like ideal gas model (see IdealGas directory)

Current aims:

 ̶0̶.̶ ̶z̶a̶b̶o̶t̶a̶t̶'̶ ̶d̶i̶f̶f̶u̶r̶y̶
1) start coding game (with my plot described above or "bounce" simply)


//09.05
Progress:
1) learned more about inheritance and virtual functions
2) implemented derived molecules for the ideal gas model; they destroy when their HP are low because of colliding (see IdealGas2 diretory)

Current aims:
1) write something that can shoot the target for my future game


//13.05
Progress:
1) made physics for the game (see GamePhysics directory)

Current aims:
1) It seems I do not have time... not sure if I'll be able to implement the whole game
