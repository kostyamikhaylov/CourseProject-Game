working out a game with graphics


Possible plot:

A number of dots (let them be enemies) crossing a 2-D field from one side to the opposite. Player is to build some kind of defense (let them be towers) to kill enemies before they manage to cross the field. The only resourse for building towers is obtained due to killing enemies. Classic

Realization:

I'm going to use SDL or, more likely, object-oriented SFML. Actually, I've never worked with graphics, so I need to learn some additional information about SDL and SFML to be sure one of them suffices to my expectations. No futher details for now.

Progress:

//28.03
1) passed Lunev
2) managed to install SFML

//04.04
1) learned about windows, shapes and events
2) wrote first program (directory FirstProg)

//12.04
1) learned about sprites and textures
2) wrote second program (I'm to lazy to upload it for now)


Current aims:

//28.03
1) start working with SFML (by reading tutorials or wathcing introducing videos)

//04.04
1) learn about sprites and textures (it'll be also useful for TechnoTrack course)

//12.04
1) learn how to make sprites automatically;
2) go on reading SFML tutorials
